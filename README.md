Blowfish Encryption Web Application
Welcome to the Blowfish Encryption Web Application! This project demonstrates the implementation of the Blowfish algorithm using HTML for the frontend and Python Flask for the backend. With an intuitive interface, you can encrypt and decrypt text securely right from your browser.

ðŸ’» Quick Start
Follow these steps to get the application up and running:

1. Install Dependencies
Before running the app, make sure to install Flask. Simply open your terminal or command prompt and run:

bash
Copy code
pip install flask
2. Navigate to Project Directory
Move into the project folder where the application files are located:

bash
Copy code
cd [project location]
Replace [project location] with the actual path to your project directory.

3. Launch the Application
Now, start the Flask server by running:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
4. Access the Application
Once the server is up, you'll see a local URL provided in your terminal (usually something like http://127.0.0.1:5000). Open your web browser, paste this link, and hit Enter to access the Blowfish Encryption Web Application.

ðŸŒŸ Features
Simple and Secure: Easily encrypt and decrypt messages using the robust Blowfish algorithm.
Interactive UI: Intuitive, user-friendly web interface developed using HTML.
Flask Backend: Flask provides a seamless and lightweight server to handle encryption requests.
ðŸŽ¯ How It Works
Encryption: Enter the text and key, click 'Encrypt', and your text will be transformed into a secure ciphertext using the Blowfish algorithm.
Decryption: Provide the encrypted text and the key, hit 'Decrypt', and the original message will be restored.
ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
app.py: Flask application that powers the backend.
templates/: Contains HTML files for the web interface.
